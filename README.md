__Repo Description:__
<br/>
This repo contains the code written by myself, Kristen Phan, as part of a Coursera course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/). Please refrain from checking out the script if you're currently taking the course.

__Problem Introduction:__
<br/>
As the last question of a successful interview, your boss gives you a few pieces of paper
with numbers on it and asks you to compose a largest number from these numbers. The
resulting number is going to be your salary, so you are very much interested in maximizing
this number. How can you do this?

__Problem Description:__
<br/>
__Task.__ Compose the largest number out of a set of integers.
<br/>
__Input Format.__ The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑛. The second line contains integers
𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛.
<br/>
__Constraints.__ 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100; 1 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 103 for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛.
<br/>
__Output Format.__ Output the largest number that can be composed out of 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛.
